# dotfiles

This is a collection of all sorts of configuration files I use for a variety of
applications.

"files/" contains the config files. Each of the files contains some information
about its contents and its purpose at the top.

"build.sh": Execute "build.sh" to install the configurations on a UNIX system.
Do this at your own risk and consider the following before doing so:
1. Installation will most likely fail. I didn't test this script on every
possible UNIX system and also don't intend on doing so.
2. Before running the script, read the instructions at the top of the
"build.sh" file. It might contain some more details.

"scripts/" are scripts used by "build.sh"
